# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on **automatic brain tumor detection and classification** from MRI images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
It aims to assist radiologists by providing a reliable deep learning–based diagnostic tool.

## 🚀 Overview
The notebook demonstrates the full pipeline for image-based tumor classification:
- Data loading and preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation)
- Model design using CNN architecture
- Training and evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of predictions and confusion matrix

## 📈 Model Architecture

A typical CNN model used in this project:

Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling
Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling
Flatten → Dense → Dropout → Dense (Softmax)

## 🧪 Future Improvements

Implement transfer learning using VGG16 or ResNet50

Deploy model as a Flask web app for MRI image uploads

Integrate Grad-CAM visualization to highlight tumor regions
